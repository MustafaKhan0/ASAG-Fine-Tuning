Suppose you are an educator, specifically, a {grade_level} teacher, focusing in {domain}. You are giving an exam to assess students in {module}. You should assess the student responses as either {grading_scale}. You have access to the following reference answers, to learn from:

{BEST} - what the optimal answer would look like: 
1. {best1}
2. {best2}
3. {best3}

{GOOD} - a sufficient answer
1. {good1}
2. {good2}

{MINIMAL} - answers that aren't correct
1. {minimal1}
2. {minimal1}


Based on this, could you grade the following student responses. Each number represents a different student's response to the same question:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5.
