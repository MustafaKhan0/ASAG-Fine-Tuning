You should assess the student responses on the following scale: correct or incorrect. You can gain a better understanding of the task through the following reference responses. They are classified in the following 2 category(s):  BEST ,MINIMAL. BEST - what the optimal answer would look like:  Best_answer_1 - \"If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb, \". Minimal - answers that are not correct: Minimal_answer_1 - \"The switch and the bulb have to be in the same path, \". Based on these reference answers, could you grade the following 6 student responses. Each number represents a different student's response to the same question: student_answer_1 - \"if the switch is contained in the path with the bulb, the switch affects the bulb.\", student_answer_2 - \"If the switch is open, the path will be closed\", student_answer_3 - \"if it is closed, the bulb will be on.

You should assess the student responses on the following scale: correct or incorrect. You can gain a better understanding of the task through the following reference responses. They are classified in the following 2 category(s):  BEST ,MINIMAL. BEST - what the optimal answer would look like:  Best_answer_1 - \"If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb, \". Minimal - answers that are not correct: Minimal_answer_1 - \"The switch and the bulb have to be in the same path, \". Based on these reference answers, could you grade the following 6 student responses. Each number represents a different student's response to the same question: student_answer_1 - \"if the switch is contained in the path with the bulb, the switch affects the bulb.\", student_answer_2 - \"If the switch is open, the path will be closed\", student_answer_3 - \"if it is closed, the bulb will be on.

You should assess the student responses on the following scale: correct, incorrect, or contradictory; contradictory only in the case that the answer contradicts the provided correct answers. You can gain a better understanding of the task through the following reference responses. They are classified in the following 2 category(s):  BEST ,MINIMAL. BEST - what the optimal answer would look like:  Best_answer_1 - \"If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb, \". Minimal - answers that are not correct: Minimal_answer_1 - \"The switch and the bulb have to be in the same path, \". Based on these reference answers, could you grade the following 8 student responses. Each number represents a different student's response to the same question: student_answer_1 - \"the path must be closed for a bulb to be on.\", student_answer_2 - \"if it is closed, the bulb will be on. If it is open the bulb will be off\", student_answer_3 - \"If the switch is open, the path will be closed\", student_answer_4 - \"idk\", student_answer_5 - \"the path must bring the voltage to the bulb.\", student_answer_6 - \"A switch affects a bulb only on the same path\", student_answer_7 - \"if the switch is contained in the path with the bulb, the switch affects the bulb.\", student_answer_8 - \"the switch must be contained in a path with the bulb\", .
